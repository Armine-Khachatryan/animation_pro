            <div class="text">The prioritized dynamic approach of high-performance computer scheduling algorithm
                is a type of HPC scheduling algorithm ("PYSA") which considers the priority of each job requests waiting
                for execution in an HPC (cluster). Compare with traditional HPC scheduling algorithms and classical PYSA
                algorithms, our evolution approach cares and actually uses the job priority when generating the job
                execution sequence. As a result, the job request execution sequence may be out of the pushing order but
                will have the HPC (cluster) to performance a 50% improvement on overall utility rate and have an overall
                21% time-saving.</div>
            <div class="text">All of our approaches go into two branches, FE and LTE. FE stands for Future
                Evolution, which is the version supports three parameters from the request. However, the LTE version,
                Long-term Evolution, not the 4G LTE, supports a flexible amount of request's description parameters. In the
                FE approach, users do not have to define their size of parameter and name of them. The reason is, in FE,
                we pre-defined that each parameter should contain four general parameters and three technical parameters.
                General classifiers are RID (Request ID), Pushing Time, Request Priority and Execution Length, and technical
                variables are CPU, GPU, and Memory. However, in LTE approach, besides four general parameters, users are
                required to define how many parameters and what they are. The method of definition will be explained below.
            </div>
            <div class="text">Other than just the algorithm, we are also providing an algorithm simulation and evaluation
                method to help developers and future researchers to better understand their newly designed scheduling
                algorithms by making comparisons between current existing scheduling algorithms. Our simulator and
                evaluation service can run algorithms coded in any language, no matter if it is C, Java, C++, Python,
                or even PHP. As long as the operating system does support such language, we are ok with it.</div>

            <div class="subTitleEvolution">What is included in the release</div>
            <div class="text">In the current release, we are providing several things. For PYSA, we only offer the LTE
                version, while the FE edition has archived as a history. We are providing two branches of PYSA-LTE. These
                two branches are both designed base on the idea of PYSA but are slightly differentiated on how they are
                doing the placement task.</div>
            <div class="text">For the simulation and evaluation service, we provide both FE and LTE versions. Don't worry,
                even if PYSA-FE is not available anymore, EVAS (the evaluation service)-FE has been modified to be adapt
                with PYSA-LTE.</div>
        </div>
        <div id="technical">
            <div class="subTitleEvolution">Technical requirements</div>
            <div class="text">Both PYSA-LTE and EVAS family REQUIRES a Unix or Linux system to proper run as expected.
                In another word, our designs are NOT compatible with Windows family systems, Windows NT, MS-DOS, and any
                other non-Unix or non-Linux systems. However, for windows users, they can run this program by installing
                the Windows Subsystem for Linux on their eligible Windows 10 devices.</div>
            <div class="text">Both PYSA-LTE and EVAS family are optimized for Apple OS X (a.k.a. Apple macOS), Apple Darwin,
                and Ubuntu because we implemented these programs under OS X and Ubuntu. To be clarified, Apple OS X systems
                are certified Unix operating systems.</div>
            <div class="text">To run our programs, we do REQUIRE user's computer to have pre-installed the latest version
                of GCC, G++, clang, C RT std=c99, C++ RT std=c++11, Python 3, pip3 by Python 3 and Java 10 (Java is
                recommended but is not required for LTE. Java is required for FE). Programs do have a hardware requirement
                to run correctly, but we believe current modern personal computers and servers are strong enough to run,
                so we will not specify the hardware requirements.</div>

            The file address is required, or the program will throw an error. Run program as ./a.out < yourConfFile>.
            For example, you can run your program as ./a.out ./input.conf, if your destinated configuration file is
            ./input.conf.</div>
        <div class="smallTitleEvolution">Input file syntax</div>
        <div class="text">As the inputting configuration file, we are expecting it to have the syntax as shown below:

        <div class="subTitleEvolution">EVAS Family executables</div>
        <div class="text">EVAS is running based on flag, that means, you will need to use flags and options to have the
            program to work for you.</div>
        <div class="smallTitleEvolution">Command Syntax General</div>
        <div class="text">We have a universal command syntax to run the program. Simply, use ./a.out -[flag] [option 0]
            ... [option N], or ./a.out --[flagLong] [option 0] ... [option N] to use long flags. Please note that,
            same as all other command-line tools such as gdb, git, and valgrind, in between each element of the command,
            please use one (1) space to separate. For flags and options, use one (1) dash for short command or two (2)
            dashes for long command. For example, a valid command can be ./a.out -l or ./a.out --list.</div>
        <div class="smallTitleEvolution">Register an algorithm</div>
        <div class="text"><span class="boldText">Syntax: </span> ./a.out -a [algorithmName] [executableDirectory]
            [executableFileName] or ./a.out --add [algorithmName] [executableDirectory] [executableFileName]. DO NOT
            use ./ prefix in the executable file name section. Algorithms will be captured and took a picture by EVAS,
            so you are free to move the algorithm to another directory, even remove it from the disk, without affecting
            the EVAS recognization.</div>
        <div class="text marginBottom"><span class="boldText">Example:</span>./a.out -a testAlgorithm ./algorithm alg.out, which
            means I want to register an algorithm whose name is testAlgorithm, the executable file is located at
            ./algorithm, and the executable is called alg.out.</div>
        <div class="smallTitleEvolution">Remove a registered algorithm from the list</div>
        <div class="text"><span class="boldText">Syntax: </span>./a.out -r [algorithmName] or ./a.out --remove
            [algorithmName].</div>
        <div class="text marginBottom"><span class="boldText">Example:</span> ./a.out -r testAlgorithm, which means I want to
            remove an algorithm which name is testAlgorithm from the list of registered algorithm list.</div>
        <div class="smallTitleEvolution">Update a registration</div>
        <div class="text"><span class="boldText">Syntax: </span> ./a.out -u [algorithmName] [executableDirectory]
            [executableFileName] or ./a.out --add [algorithmName] [executableDirectory] [executableFileName]. DO NOT
            use ./ prefix in the executable file name section. The to be updated algorithm must be already registered
            in EVAS. Please use the exact spelling of the registred algorithm, or the program will throw an error. To
            rename a registered algorithm, please remove it from the list first by using -r flag, and then use -a flag
            to re-register the algorithm with the new name.</div>
        <div class="text marginBottom"><span class="boldText">Example:</span>./a.out -u testAlgorithm ./algorithm_new alg_new.out,
            which means I want to update an algorithm registration which name is testAlgorithm, with the new executable
            file located at ./algorithm_new, and the executable is called alg_new.out.</div>
        <div class="smallTitleEvolution">View the registration list</div>
        <div class="text"><span class="boldText">Exact command:</span>./a.out -l or ./a.out --list</div>
        <div class="smallTitleEvolution">Comparison</div>
        <div class="text">The default mode of the comparator will do the comparison and print out only the minimum
            information, which is essential for developers to understand the simulation execution status and the
            evaluation result. To get more info regarding the simulation and evaluation, please use an option to re-run
            the program. Without a specified inputting configuration, EVAS will automatically generate testing cases,
            but these testing cases are FE-type description only. Users can use multiple options regardless of the
            sequence. In comparison, please run command:./a.out -c [option 0] ... [option N]. The following section
            will only talk about options.</div>
        <div class="italicText">Default mode</div>
        <div class="text">No options specification required.</div>
        <div class="italicText">Timing mode</div>
        <div class="text">-t or --time. The timing mode will also print out the timing statics to show EVAS took how
            long time to do what process. For example, it can say, "Input conf process used 0.001388 seconds," which
            means it cost EVAS 0.001388 seconds to capture and process the inputting configuration.</div>
        <div class="italicText">Ranking mode</div>
        <div class="text">-r or --rank. This mode will prints out all registered algorithms with their evaluation
            result, which is the score and ranking of each of the listed algorithms. For example, EVAS can say
            "Position 1: 19AGA3540729150245413 (a.k.a. s1): 57.000000."</div>
        <div class="italicText">Detailed mode</div>
        <div class="text">-d or --detail. In detailed mode, EVAS will print out all of the internal status and
            temporary objects. i.e., original request list, algorithm execution status map according to its output, and
            algorithms alter IDs. In the FE version, EVAS can print more things, for example, the original algorithm
            output.</div>
        <div class="italicText">Specifying an input source</div>
        <div class="text">-f=[fileAddress] or --file=[fileAddress]. By specifying a configuration file, EVAS will use
            the input instead of an auto-generated configuration. By specifying a source, developers can further
            optimize their algorithms by focusing on their special computing need.</div>
